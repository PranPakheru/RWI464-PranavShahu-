/*
 * It is a special form of Association where:  

It represents Has-Aâ€™s relationship.
It is a unidirectional association i.e. a one-way relationship. For example, 
a department can have students but vice versa is not possible and thus unidirectional in nature.
In Aggregation, both entries can survive individually which means ending one entity will not affect the other entity.
 */


/*
 * Explanation of the above Program:

In this example,

There is an Institute which has no. of departments like CSE, EE. Every department has no. of students.
So, we make an Institute class that has a reference to Object or no. of Objects (i.e. List of Objects) of the Department class.
That means Institute class is associated with Department class through its Object(s).
And Department class has also a reference to Object or Objects (i.e. List of Objects) of the Student class means
 it is associated with the Student class through its Object(s). 
It represents a Has-A relationship. In the above example: Student Has-A name. Student Has-A ID.
